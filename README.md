# Regression-Model-Selector

The designed regression model selector, takes only a moderately big dataset as an input and is sequenced by preprocessing of data, backward elimination and regression itself. The name and the graph of the best regression model with respect to the least root mean square is printed along with the number of relevant columns of the dataset. Run it to actually view the results!
