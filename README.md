# Regression-Model-Selector
The designed regression model selector, takes only a moderately big dataset as an input and is sequenced by preprocessing of data, backward elimination and regression itself. The name and the graph of the best regression model with respect to the least root mean square is printed along with the number of relevant columns of the dataset. Inclued regression models are: Multiple Linear, SVR, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Lasso, Elastic Net, and Ridge.

Run it to actually view the results!

## Why use it
1. This model automates the process of searching the best suited regression model for your dataset - you get the output in a single click
2. It takes into account the parameter tuning required to eliminate the unrelated data-columns (independent variables)
3. The output holds performance information about all the models to equip you better to make a decision
